A Java multithreaded application that simulates a banking system
Design and implement a Student Record Management System using Java that allows for the management of student records (add, update, delete, search, and view) with persistent storage. The application must support exception handling, file handling (to store and retrieve data), multithreading (to simulate loading), and must leverage the Java Collections Framework. The system should allow sorting of students by marks, provide the option to search and delete student records, and display the sorted list of students. Additionally, the system should use OOP concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces to ensure modular and reusable code.
